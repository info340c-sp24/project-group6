  <h1>Group 6 Project Proposal</h1>

    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
      The University of Washington faces ongoing safety concerns that need to be addressed.
      According to a survey reported by
      <a href="https://mynorthwest.com/3928617/survey-uw-one-30-most-dangerous-campuses-us-violent-crime/">MyNorthwest</a>
      , UW is ranked among the 30 most dangerous
      campuses in the US due to incidents of violent crime. This poses a significant threat to
      the safety and well-being of students, faculty, and staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there are existing safety measures in place, such as the
      <a href="https://police.uw.edu/safezone-app/?_gl=1*1gsbbtn*_ga*ODQyNTg1MTI5LjE2MzQyNDU1NDM.*_ga_JLHM9WH4JV*MTcxMjM1NjgwMC4zOC4xLjE3MTIzNTk2OTIuMC4wLjA.*_ga_3T65WK0BM8*MTcxMjM1NjgwMC4zOC4xLjE3MTIzNTk2OTIuMC4wLjA.">SafeZone app</a>,
      <a href="https://transportation.uw.edu/getting-around/shuttles/nightride">NightRide shuttle service</a>,
      and <a href="https://www.washington.edu/safety/alert/">UW Alerts</a>, there is a lack of a centralized platform
      for accessing safety information and reporting incidents in real-time. This gap indicates
      a need for an integrated solution that combines safety alerts, NightRide information,
      and other relevant safety resources into one cohesive application accessible to the UW community.
      Given these challenges...
    </p>
    <strong>
      How might we organize UW's array of safety
      resources and information into one accessible platform, to enhance
      the overall safety and security of the campus community?
    </strong>

    <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
    <p>
      Our proposed solution aims to address the pressing need for a comprehensive and centralized
      safety platform for the University of Washington community by consolidating all existing safety
      resources and information into one accessible web application. The target audience of our
      application will include UW students, faculty, and staff. This app can have a significant
      impact on those with disabilities who may face barriers to accessing information online.
    </p>
    <p>Key features will include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Safety Report:</strong>
        <p>
          Users can submit reports of safety concerns or incidents directly
          through the app, including the ability to upload photos or videos.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Personalized Safety Notifications:</strong>
        <p>
          Users can personalize their notification settings
          to receive alerts about specific safety updates or incidents relevant to their preferences.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chat Support:</strong>
        <p>
          Allow users to communicate with campus safety personnel or counselors for assistance or guidance.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Husky Nightwalk Online Reservation System:</strong>
        <p>
          Create efficiency within the nightwalk service by using a real-time interface (like Uber),
          which will help users with disabilities, making it easier for them to reserve a ride.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The content presented within this application will comprise a compilation of existing
      resources sourced from the University of Washington's Division of Campus Community and Safety.
      This division serves as a hub for information through three key emergency and safety response units:
      UW Emergency Management, UW SafeCampus, and UW Police Seattle.
      For more information, visit <a href="https://www.washington.edu/safety/">UW Campus Community Safety</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      By creating a comprehensive safety app for UW, this solution would address the fragmentation
      of existing safety resources and provide a centralized platform for students, faculty, and staff
      to access essential safety information and report incidents. Such an app could enhance campus safety
      by facilitating timely communication and response to safety concerns. While there may be other
      safety apps or university-specific platforms addressing similar needs, none may provide the specific
      combination of features tailored to UW's unique requirements. Therefore, a new app designed specifically
      for UW would fill this gap and potentially improve the overall safety and security of the campus community.
